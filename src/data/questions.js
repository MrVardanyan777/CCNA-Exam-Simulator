        question: "Which statement correctly compares traditional networks and controller-based networks?",
        options: {
            A: "Only traditional networks offer a centralized control plane",
            B: "Only traditional networks natively support centralized management",
            C: "Traditional and controller-based networks abstract policies from device configurations",
            D: "Only controller-based networks decouple the control plane and the data plane"
        },
        correctAnswer: ["D"],
        explanation: "Most traditional devices use a distributed architecture, in which each control plane is resided in a networking device. Therefore they need to communicate with each other via messages to work correctly. In contrast to distributed architecture, centralized (or controller-based) architectures centralizes the control of networking devices into one device, called SDN controller.",

            E: "The router must use the advertised distance as the metric for any given route"
        },
        correctAnswer: ["B", "C"],
        explanation: "The reported distance (or advertised distance) is the cost from the neighbor to the destination. It is calculated from the router advertising the route to the network. Feasible successor is the backup route. To be a feasible successor, the route must have an Advertised distance (AD) less than the Feasible distance (FD) of the current successor route. Feasible distance (FD): The sum of the AD plus the cost between the local router and the next-hop router. The router must calculate the FD of all paths to choose the best path to put into the routing table.",
